If an explicit [ScrollPhysics] is provided in [physics], it will take precedence, followed by [scrollBehavior], and then the inherited ancestor [ScrollBehavior]. The [ScrollBehavior] of the inherited [ScrollConfiguration] will be modified by default to not apply a [Scrollbar]. This is because the NestedScrollView cannot assume the configuration of the outer and inner [Scrollable] widgets, particularly whether to treat them as one scrollable, or separate and desirous of unique behaviors." />

A [SliverToBoxAdapter] is a basic sliver that creates a bridge back to one of the usual box-based widgets. Rather than using multiple [SliverToBoxAdapter] widgets to display multiple box widgets in a [CustomScrollView], consider using [SliverList], [SliverFixedExtentList], [SliverPrototypeExtentList], or [SliverGrid], which are more efficient because they instantiate only those children that are actually visible through the scroll view's viewport." />
