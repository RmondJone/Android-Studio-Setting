      <item value="/** * Sets the clockwise rotation angle in degrees relative to the * orientation of the camera. This affects the pictures returned from * JPEG {@link PictureCallback}.

If the Jpeg picture is * rotated, the orientation in the EXIF header will be missing or 1 (row * #0 is top and column #0 is left side). * * &lt;p&gt; * If applications want to rotate the picture to match the orientation * of what users see, apps should use * {@link android.view.OrientationEventListener} and * {@link android.hardware.Camera.CameraInfo}. The value from * OrientationEventListener is relative to the natural orientation of * the device. CameraInfo.orientation is the angle between camera * orientation and natural device orientation.
