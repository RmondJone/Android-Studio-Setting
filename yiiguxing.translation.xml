It also gives the * client access to the zoom controls container, allowing for additional * accessory buttons to be shown in the zoom controls window. * &lt;p&gt; * Typically, clients should call {@link #setVisible(boolean) setVisible(true)} * on a touch down or move (no need to call {@link #setVisible(boolean) * setVisible(false)} since it will time out on its own). Also, whenever the * owner cannot be zoomed further, the client should update * {@link #setZoomInEnabled(boolean)} and {@link #setZoomOutEnabled(boolean)}. * &lt;p&gt; * If you are using this with a custom View, please call * {@link #setVisible(boolean) setVisible(false)} from * {@link View#onDetachedFromWindow} and from {@link View#onVisibilityChanged} * when &lt;code&gt;visibility != View.VISIBLE&lt;/code&gt;. * * @deprecated This functionality and UI is better handled with custom views and layouts * rather than a dedicated zoom-control widget */" />
